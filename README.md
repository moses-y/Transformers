üöÄ Welcome to the TRANSFORMERS repository, where the magic of Python code generation happens! This experimental project harnesses the power of the GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on a small dataset from Huggingface(ü§ó) focus on Python programming language patterns. Whether you're battling bugs or seeking a spark of syntactical inspiration, TRANSFORMERS is your co-pilot in the coding journey.

## üóÇ Project Structure

Here's how we're organized:

```
/TRANSFORMERS
|-- /__pycache__              # Bytecode cache for quicker startup
|-- /.vscode                  # VSCode workspace settings
|-- /src
|   |-- /data
|   |   |-- train_data.py     # The chef's recipe for cooking raw data into delicious datasets
|   |-- /models
|   |   |-- gpt2finetune.py   # The alchemist's formula for transmuting base GPT-2 into Pythonic gold
|   |   |-- model_checkpoint_epoch_*.pt  # Time capsules of model knowledge
|   |-- /scripts
|   |   |-- text_generation.py  # The oracle's tool for divining Python code from the ether
|-- README.md                  # The map to this treasure trove
|-- LICENSE                    # The open scroll of legal text
|-- requirements.txt           # The alchemist's list of mystical ingredients
```

## üõ† Setup

Embark on your journey by cloning this mystical repository:

```bash
